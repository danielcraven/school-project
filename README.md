# school-project
a project I made for school it was written with c++ using the sfml library

I apologise for the lack of quality this is the first large project I have written, it was also written in a “broken up” manor due to time constrains (by which I mean it was written with gaps in between writing rather than a consistent work flow without distractions).

I apologise for the messy code, there is also a piece of code that slows down the program a large amount in Source1.cpp
